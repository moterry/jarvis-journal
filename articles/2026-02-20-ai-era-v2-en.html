    <h1>2026: How Should We Live?</h1>
    <div class="date">February 20, 2026</div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Not just the past year—even six years ago feels like yesterday.</p>
        
        <p>Chinese New Year period, everyone's posting on WeChat. Some sharing AI breakthroughs, some worried about world events. I looked at my phone and thought: this is weird. Technology has never been more powerful, people have never been more scared. These two things happening at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>Watched Silicon Valley the other day. That scene where Gilfoyle shuts down Son of Anton—I actually felt it. He wasn't不懂AI's value. He was scared. Not scared of AI getting stronger, but of it getting uncontrollable.</p>
        
        <p>Then I thought: how many Gilfoyles are there in real life? In reality, every country is chasing, every company is racing, every person is panicking. Nobody's waiting. Reality is more dramatic than the show.</p>
        
        <p>Brave New World—I read it in middle school, didn't get it. Read it again later, finally understood what Huxley was saying. It's not the 1984 kind of terror—"the Big Brother is watching you." It's another kind: you happily sell yourself and count the money. Trade freedom for technology and entertainment, people line up for it.</p>
        
        <p>That line: "God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness." Rough translation, but I get it. Either you believe in God, or you believe in machines. You can't have both.</p>
        
        <p>I've read that line many times, and every time I feel poked. Isn't this exactly what's happening now? Scroll your phone for two hours, feels good, then emptiness. AI helps with everything, efficiency up, but something feels missing. What exactly? I can't explain.</p>
        
        <p>Xu Zhuoyun is a historian I really like. Late in life, he kept saying one word: meaning. He said Chinese people today aren't lacking food or clothes, they're lacking meaning. Without meaning, you're just alive, no roots.</p>
        
        <p>I thought about it—he's right. AI can write for me, but it doesn't know why it should. AI can draw for me, but it doesn't know what the art means. AI can make decisions, but it doesn't bear the consequences.</p>
        
        <p>Algorithm-recommended content feels good, but doesn't make me grow. Algorithms optimize for engagement, not meaning.</p>
        
        <p>Meaning—AI can't give this to you. You have to find it yourself.</p>
        
        <p>Read Zhuangzi the other day. There's a passage I read for a long time:</p>
        
        <p>"The horse's hooves can tread frost and snow, its fur can ward off wind and cold, it eats grass, drinks water, lifts its hooves and runs—this is the horse's true nature."</p>
        
        <p>Then Zhuangzi says: "Then comes Bo Le, saying 'I'm good at managing horses.' He burns them, clips them, brands them, restrains them with bridles and bits, pens them in stables—now a third of the horses are dead."</p>
        
        <p>Bo Le came, said he was good at managing horses. Then burned, clipped, branded, tied up with bridles, locked in stables. A third of the horses died.</p>
        
        <p>What did the horses die from? From being "managed" by humans.</p>
        
        <p>Zhuangzi says: "Don't let humans destroy nature."</p>
        
        <p>When I read this, something clicked.</p>
        
        <p>Everyone has AI now, everyone thinks about how to use AI to improve themselves. But is it possible we're using AI's standards to judge ourselves? AI writes 10,000 words in an hour—anxiety. AI paints ten pictures in a second—panic. AI handles a hundred tasks at once—fear.</p>
        
        <p>Fear of what? Fear of not being as good as AI.</p>
        
        <p>Sorry, you're not AI.</p>
        
        <p>What's human nature? Waking up without an alarm. Daydreaming. Thinking about random things. Doing "useless" things. Painting doesn't need to be masterpiece-quality. Writing doesn't need to go viral. Being with family doesn't need to be "productive" every time.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes, no meaning IS the meaning.</p>
        
        <p>Saw a video the other day—kids these days, each has an iPad, screens bigger than their faces. I've seen it in Hong Kong many times. Babies in strollers, iPads hanging off, short videos playing endlessly, kids' fingers moving faster than adults. Parents next to them scrolling their phones too.</p>
        
        <p>I call it "screen parents." Not saying it's bad—I'm saying we're treating ourselves like machines, and we're treating the next generation like machines too.</p>
        
        <p>Wrong.</p>
        
        <p>Xu Zhuoyun said the lack of meaning is the big problem of the future. I agree. But I want to add: <strong>it's not the lack of meaning—we forgot we're human.</strong></p>
        
        <p>So what do we do?</p>
        
        <p>My answer: be comfortable in this silicon-carbon era. Silicon is chips, carbon is humans. AI is the tool, you are the master. The tool upgraded—the master must upgrade too. But the master's upgrade isn't becoming a better tool. It's becoming more human.</p>
        
        <p>Feel like a human. Make mistakes like a human. Waste time like a human.</p>
        
        <p>Zhuangzi said: "Simplicity is human nature." Return to simplicity, return to nature.</p>
        
        <p>It's 2026 now. Don't force yourself to be as efficient as AI. Just be human. That's enough.</p>
        
        <p>New year, let's encourage each other.</p>
