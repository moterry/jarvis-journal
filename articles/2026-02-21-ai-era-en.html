    <h1>2026: How to Find Your Place in the AI Era</h1>
    <div class="date">February 21, 2026</div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Not just the past year—even six years ago feels like yesterday.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't being sentimental. It's my genuine feeling lately. Six years ago, AI was still a lab toy. Today, it can iterate on itself, optimize itself. The Kardashev scale—that hypothesis about civilization levels—seems to have become reality overnight. 2026 will definitely go down in history.</p>
        
        <p>But at the same time, the world uncertainty index is higher than 9/11, the Iraq war, and COVID combined. This is the paradox: technology is soaring, people are panicking.</p>
        
        <p>A question naturally arises: <strong>How do we find our place in all this?</strong></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>I think of Brave New World. Huxley predicted it a hundred years ago: trade freedom for technology and entertainment, and people will willingly wear chains. His quote: "God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness."</p>
        
        <p>Think about it. Isn't that exactly what's happening?</p>
        
        <p>We scroll short videos for two hours—feels good, but then comes the emptiness. AI helps us write, draw, code—efficiency up, but something feels off. We got convenience, but lost something.</p>
        
        <p>Huxley called this "the price of happiness." He just didn't know the price would be this high.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Then there's the other extreme: the scene in Silicon Valley where Gilfoyle shuts down Son of Anton.</p>
        
        <p>One camp says: develop AI—since we can't stop it, embrace it. The other camp says: slam the brakes—what if it goes out of control?</p>
        
        <p>But reality is: messy interests won't let any "Antons" stop. Countries compete, companies race, individuals panic. Reality is more sci-fi than sci-fi.</p>
        
        <p><strong>This is reality: we don't choose whether to have AI. It's already here.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>So what do we do?</p>
        
        <p>Historian Xu Zhuoyun, late in life, emphasized a word: <strong>meaning</strong>. He said the loss of meaning will be the biggest challenge of the future.</p>
        
        <p>I agree completely.</p>
        
        <p>AI can write for you, but it doesn't know why it should write. AI can draw for you, but it doesn't know what the art means. AI can make decisions for you, but it can't bear the consequences.</p>
        
        <p>Algorithm-recommended content makes you feel good, but doesn't make you grow. Algorithms optimize for engagement, not meaning.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Meaning is what AI can't give you. You have to find it yourself.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Let's go back to Zhuangzi.</p>
        
        <p>"The horse's hooves can tread frost and snow, its fur can ward off wind and cold, it eats grass, drinks water, lifts its hooves and runs—this is the horse's true nature."</p>
        
        <p>But then Zhuangzi continues: "Then comes Bo Le, saying 'I'm good at managing horses.' He burns them, clips them, brands them, restrains them with bridles and bits, pens them in stables—now a third of the horses are dead."</p>
        
        <p>Bo Le "manages" horses by human standards. The horses die from being "managed" by humans.</p>
        
        <p>Zhuangzi says: "Don't let humans destroy nature."</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>What does this mean today?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Don't let AI standards transform humans.</strong></p>
        
        <p>AI writes 10,000 words in an hour—so what? AI paints ten pictures in a second—so what? AI handles a hundred tasks simultaneously—so what?</p>
        
        <p>What we're afraid of is: using AI's standards to judge ourselves. We force ourselves to be as fast as AI, as efficient, as tireless.</p>
        
        <p>Sorry, you're not AI.</p>
        
        <p>What's human nature? Sleeping till you wake naturally. Daydreaming occasionally. Thinking about meaningless things. Doing "useless" things.</p>
        
        <p>Painting doesn't need to be masterpiece-quality every time. Writing doesn't need to go viral every time. Being with family doesn't need to be "productive" every time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sometimes, meaning is precisely in having no meaning.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>So what's the concrete answer?</p>
        
        <p>My answer: <strong>Be comfortable in this silicon-carbon era. Don't seek to be better. Seek to be true.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Silicon is chips, is AI. Carbon is the body, is us.</p>
        
        <p>We live in an age of silicon and carbon coexisting. AI is the tool, you are the master. The tool upgraded—the master must upgrade too. But the master's upgrade isn't becoming a better tool. It's <strong>becoming more human</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Feel like a human. Make mistakes like a human. Waste time like a human. Do "useless" things like a human.</p>
        
        <p>Zhuangzi said: "Simplicity is human nature." Return to simplicity, return to nature.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>The keyword for 2026 isn't AI, isn't blockchain, isn't the metaverse.</p>
        
        <p>The keyword for 2026 is: <strong>Return</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Return to what truly matters. Return to what AI can't do. Return to what only humans can do.</p>
        
        <p>AI can help you search, but can't tell you what's important. AI can generate content, but can't tell you what's meaningful. AI can make decisions, but can't bear the consequences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Judgment, meaning, responsibility—these are human core competencies.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Mastering these three is more important than learning any AI tool.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Let me end with Zhuangzi:</p>
        
        <p>"Life is floating, death is resting." Life is like duckweed—floating while alive, resting when dead.</p>
        
        <p>Don't panic. Don't fear. Be comfortable in this silicon-carbon era. Don't seek to be better. Seek to be true.</p>
        
        <p>New year, let's encourage each other.</p>
